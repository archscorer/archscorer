* https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/#djangomodelpermissions -- is another way to go

Iga vibu harjutuse per class top tulemused aasta lõikes

archiving event should set some backend limitations as well.. some more tests and
limitations on frontend on combined with registration switch.

ja kui statistikat teha, siis ntg per võistlus: osalejaid kokku A/V osalejaid /C/J osalejad, lastud rekordid

Scorecard editing capability. Event creator or admin should be able to create scorecards without arrows
 (i.e. only scores and spots are marked on scorecard).
 As well there should be 'checked' flag on ScoreCard that event admin can click while checking scores
 on paper vs virtual. This click would also trigger class_level and record check!

To better manage archers profiles, add archer club also directly to participant
model. This will enable club changes, but participant club will stay safe.
This will also make past events safer.

Issue might be, when some clubs continue to exist, but step out of FAAE. I have
no good solution for that. This affects series.
