        Create, score and archive archery events. The site is work in progress.
        The main functionality can be found under 'events' page where you can
        create new events - for personal training sessions, have fun with club
        as well conduct official competitions.
      </p>

        First it might be good idea to create user account by either logging in
        with your Google account or create local account. Then try the site out
        on a training session. Then please give feedback -- 'info @ archscorer .

        As mentioned site is work in progress. From some things I have very
        solid idea how it should be, some other features I have vague ideas or
        haven't tought about it at all. <b>Your feedback is important</b> and
        helps the site to get better :)
      </p>

      <h2 class="headline font-weight-bold mb-3">Important</h2>

      <p colour="alert">
        After creating user account or by logging in with Google - check your
        profile (menu selection if clicked on your email address).
